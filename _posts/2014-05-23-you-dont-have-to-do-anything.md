# You don't have to do anything

I want you follow me down a strange and interesting thought experiment. 

We all have things that we have to do. Much of the precious minutes of our short lives gets spent completing those things we *have to* do. For many of us, have-to-dos represent the majority of our time. For some us, nearly every waking minute is spent getting things done that we have to do.

But we don't HAVE to do those things. There is no element of Newtonian physics that requires you to go work on Monday. No part of string theory compels you to reply to your emails. You don't have to pick up your laundry from the dry cleaners. You could just leave it there.

So I want you to start making a list of everything that takes up time during your week. You can use this week if you've already got your schedule, or just a typical week. Start making the list of all the things you have to do and about how much time they will take up. You can be as detailed or vague as you like. 

Write the list down if you want to.

### Do that now.








### Ok, now go through each item one by one and let's acknowledge that technically speaking, you are not forced to do them. 

Now visualize in a very detailed manner how you could unburden yourself from them. The trick here is to really walk through and visualize every step.

So of course you have to quick your job, that's a big chunk of your have-to's for sure. So, mentally quit your job. You can just dash off and email, handwrite a letter and walk it in to your boss, or you can go all Office Space. It's up to you but visualize it the whole way through.

### Ok, you quit your job, keep going down the list. 

* Delete your Facebook and Gmail.
*
*
*

If you wrote the list down, start making little notes on how you'd dump each thing.

### Now things get a bit dicey because you have some moral obligations. But stick with me here. We're getting rid of ALL of our have-to's in this experiment. EVERYTHING. Moral obligation or not.

Write a heartfelt letter to your family that you will no longer be visiting for any holidays.

Got kids? Get rid of the buggers. Buy them a round the world flight and send them on their way. Too young travel? Drop them off on Angelina Jolie's stoop. Or just don't ever pick them up from day care. Honestly, they'll probably be fine.

Really visualize this stupid stuff. Do it in your head, every incredibly awkward minute of it.

### Now, look at your life. Look at the free day in front of you. Look at the open week ahead. Look at the decades of the rest of your life. A blank canvas, totally unburdened of obligations and yours to fill with only things that you WANT to do.

Now, if your day/week/life doesn't look like this, it's because you are choosing for it not to be.

### Try this from time to time

I find this to be incredibly helpful when I'm worrying about stuff I have to do. I take a moment, visualize exactly how I would go about just not doing any of it, with as much practicality and detail as I can. I compare multiple options, consider the ramifications. In a minute or two I have a Plan B and then I just decide to either *do that* or not to and stop freaking out about it (pro tip: sometimes you *should* do it).
