# Better Disconnecting and Pull Notifications

Reading the excellent, [Hidden in Plain Sight](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008B0ULDW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008B0ULDW&linkCode=as2&tag=tyletrin-20&linkId=GOIIMPLJLTNRWCXS) by Jan Chipchase. This paragraph in particular caught my attention.

> Additionally, free time, and the freedom to use time autonomously, has increasingly positive connotations. This seems to suggest that as society becomes more hyperconnected, the ability to disconnect and stay disconnected will become a more significant sign of status. If it’s increasingly difficult to switch off—to not pick up the phone, to take a three-week vacation—then switching off will become a privilege for the few who can afford to do so.

This is so spot on. The Instagram feed, constantly updated with the cool non-work things you're doing, is the new status symbol.

A few years ago hyperconnectivity was a status symbol, think the bluetooth headset, Can you hear me now? Now in a world where everyone is always on 24/7, the ability to disconnect is becoming the scarcer commodity. 

## A boy do we badly need some disconnecting.

Patrick Collison's little quip on Twitter reminded me of this study. Rats, or pigeons, I can't remember, are kept in a cage with a button. In one cage pushing the button produces a treat at predictable intervals, once a day or once an hour. The birds, or rats, eventually figure it out, more or less hitting the button only once a day to get their treat and leaving it alone. The researchers then change to a new pattern, say once and hour, and the winged-or-not-vermin are confused for a bit but get accustomed to the pattern again.

In the other cage though, the button/treat relationship is completely randomized. Pushing a button might deliver a treat 12 times in a row, then nothing for days, then once an hour, and so on. The rats, never being being to predict whether or not the button will reward them, essentially go insane, pushing the button constantly. 

That's what my mobile phone feels like sometimes. Every unlock holds the potential for some treat: a new email reply, a notification of a big new customer, a clever article on Medium. But it's totally unpredictable and thus I end up constantly taking a quick peek just in case.  

## Switch to pull notifications in 2 minutes

Jeremy Vandehey's (This is Your Brain on Mobile)[https://medium.com/@jgvandehey/this-is-your-brain-on-mobile-15308056cfae] is a great read on how terrible our mobile connectivity is for our brains and what to do about it.


There is some great practical advice in the article:

> 1. Keep it in your pants.
> 6. Buy a watch
> 7. No phones in the bedroom or bathroom

But my favorite is:

> 4. Never push. Always pull. Unless your wife is expecting a baby at any minute, there’s nothing more important than the people you are with in that moment. Turn ALL notifications & badges off. Set your phone to silent (not VIBRATE). Don’t even allow yourself the temptation to swipe and catch up on the latest insta-snap-vine-whatsapp-videos. Don’t take away from the beautiful, seemingly insignificant, uninstagrammable moment you are having with the people you love. These nasty notifications also distract you from work, hobbies, and passions. Keep your focus. Buzzfeed’s top 25 beach bodies can wait. When mobile browsing is acceptable, PULL the information you seek (manual refresh, etc). Don’t let it come to you. Cold turkey. No exceptions.

I like this a lot but I thin it only explains the "never push" part and doesn't help with how to be a better at pulling the information you did actually miss. I'm a bit of a moron and the iOS Notification Center settings have always been pretty opaque to me. But I recently took two minutes to set it up so that my Notification Center (the thing you see when you pull down from the top of the iPhone screen) actually gives me a useful overview missed notifications.

Go to Settings > Notification Center

Go through all the apps below "Include." The thing that confused me is that these pages control both the alerts you get "as it happens" and whether or not they go into the Notification Center. 

For almost everything you want to go to:

1. set alert style to None
2. turn off Badge Icon and Alert Sound to none
3. Turn off Show in Notification Center (you want to edit down your Notification Center to actual stuff you care about).

![alerts off, notification center on](/assets/pull-notifications-2.png)

For some things I want a central record of what happened that I can "pull." Twitter notifications, Paypal expenses, calendar invites, etc. 

For these you still want to do #1 and #2 above but you do want them to "Show in Notification Center" and maybe you even want to Include "10 recent items" if you're doing a good job and not checking your phone very often. 

If you set it up this way, checking your Notification Center actually gives a good overview of stuff that has happened recently and hopefully will help with the FOMO of not checking your phone every 2 seconds.
